ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  did not find expected key
The error appears to be in '/home/gitlab-runner/builds/Wtc2G1gT4/0/hmno-devops/weekly-audit/ansible/SendReportsMail.yaml': line 31, column 9, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.
The offending line appears to be:
          Attached is the audit reports zip file.
        args:
        ^ here
